# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook that predicts the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on selected symptoms. Designed to be integrated into a web application, this tool allows users to input symptoms and receive an assessment that can assist in preliminary Parkinson's detection.

## Project Overview

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder, and early detection is crucial. This project enables users to assess the likelihood of Parkinson's disease by analyzing symptom selection and predefined symptom frequency levels. It offers an accessible tool for healthcare providers and individuals interested in understanding potential indicators of Parkinson's disease.

## Key Features

- **Symptom-Based Detection**: Users select from a list of common symptoms. Each symptom is classified as high or mid-level based on predefined frequency levels, enhancing prediction accuracy.
- **Minimum Symptom Requirement**: Ensures that users provide a sufficient number of symptoms for a reliable prediction, minimizing results based on incomplete information.
- **Web Integration Ready**: The model can be embedded in a website application, making it easier for users to interact with the tool and obtain preliminary results.

## Usage

This notebook includes the full code for data loading, model training, and prediction. Developers can integrate this model into web applications or use it as a standalone tool for machine learning experimentation.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to load data and initialize the model.
3. Use the symptom selection and prediction sections to evaluate Parkinson's likelihood.

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements include expanding the symptom dataset, refining classifications, and integrating additional features for greater accuracy.
