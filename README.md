# Speech Emotion Recognition - Sound Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for implementing a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, aimed at identifying emotions in audio recordings. The model classifies sounds based on emotional cues using machine learning and signal processing techniques, making it applicable for sentiment analysis, customer support enhancement, and multimedia applications.

## Project Overview

Emotion recognition in speech is valuable for improving user interactions in various fields. This project uses an SER model to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and others from speech recordings. By analyzing vocal patterns, pitch, and other audio features, the model can accurately detect emotions embedded within audio inputs.

## Key Features

- **Audio Feature Extraction**: Extracts key audio features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma, and spectral contrast, which are critical for distinguishing emotions in speech.
- **Emotion Classification**: Classifies speech recordings into distinct emotion categories using a machine learning classifier, trained and evaluated on labeled emotion datasets.
- **Customizable Model Pipeline**: The model pipeline is modular, allowing customization and tuning to improve classification accuracy or adapt to new datasets.

## Usage

The notebook provides code for preprocessing audio data, extracting features, training the model, and evaluating performance. It can serve as a foundation for developers and researchers aiming to build or enhance SER systems.

## Installation

To run this notebook:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook to train and test the model on emotion datasets.

## Applications

This SER model can enhance customer service, improve accessibility tools, and be used in entertainment for responsive systems that react to users' emotions in real-time.

## Future Work

Future enhancements could include fine-tuning with deep learning techniques, expanding the emotion classes, or implementing real-time emotion recognition.
